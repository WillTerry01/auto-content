> **⚠️ OUTDATED PROJECT**: This repository is no longer maintained and was built using the GPT-3.0 API when it first came out in as a learning experience for API calls.

## Overview

This repository was used for code storage and testing during early experimentation with OpenAI's API. The project explored using GPT API calls to generate content for short-form videos (Instagram/TikTok), including recipe generation, image creation with DALL-E, and text-to-speech functionality. Since then (Late 2025) GPT has become more powerful and something like this is not really needed, with apps alrready created to make short form content easy.

## Dependencies

- `openai` - OpenAI Python SDK
- Python 3.x standard libraries: `json`, `base64`, `binascii`, `pathlib`

## Note

This was purely an experimental learning project and never reached production. The code serves as a reference for basic API integration patterns from the GPT-3.0 era.
